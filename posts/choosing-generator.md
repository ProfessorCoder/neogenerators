When it comes to home backup power, one size does not fit all. At NeoGenerators, we offer a $395 home assessment to calculate your electrical and gas needs so you get the perfect generatorâ€”whether it's Generac or Briggs & Stratton.

Our certified team will evaluate key appliances, square footage, and service panel capacity to provide a right-fit recommendation you can rely on.
