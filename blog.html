  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Why More Northeast Ohio Homeowners Are Installing Backup Generators in 2025</h1>

  <p>From unexpected ice storms to aging infrastructure, Ohioans have faced a growing number of power outages in recent years. As a result, more homeowners in <strong>Akron, Cleveland, Medina, Canton</strong>, and surrounding areas are turning to standby generators as a reliable backup power solution.</p>

  <h2>The Reality of Outages in Northeast Ohio</h2>
  <p>According to recent data, power outages in Northeast Ohio have increased by over 30% since 2020. With weather extremes becoming more frequent and the electrical grid under strain, whole-home generators are no longer a luxury — they're a necessity.</p>

  <h2>What Is a Standby Generator?</h2>
  <p>Unlike portable units, standby generators automatically kick on when your home loses power. They're permanently installed outside your home and powered by natural gas or propane. Brands like <strong>Generac</strong> and <strong>Briggs & Stratton</strong> lead the industry in reliable solutions.</p>

  <h2>Top 3 Reasons to Install a Generator in Ohio</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>1. Protect Your Home:</strong> Prevent frozen pipes, flooded basements, and food spoilage during outages.</li>
    <li><strong>2. Keep Working from Home:</strong> Stay online and productive, even when the grid is down.</li>
    <li><strong>3. Increase Home Value:</strong> Backup power is a high-demand feature for modern buyers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How to Choose the Right Size</h2>
  <p>At NeoGenerators, we offer a <strong>$395 home energy assessment</strong> to calculate your gas and electrical usage and ensure your generator is sized correctly. Oversizing wastes money; undersizing leaves you vulnerable. We get it right.</p>
